    "2 large bunches of spinach, about 1 lb",
    "Olive oil, extra virgin",
    "1/2 teaspoon garlic salt",

directions = [
    "Cut off the thick stems of the spinach and discard. Clean the spinach by filling up your sink with water and soaking the spinach to loosen any sand or dirt. Drain the spinach and then repeat soaking and draining. Put the spinach in a salad spinner to remove any excess moisture.",
    "Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until the garlic is just beginning to brown.",
    "Add the spinach to the pan, packing it down a bit if you need to with your hand. Use a couple spatulas to lift the spinach and turn it over in the pan so that you coat more of it with the olive oil and garlic. Do this a couple of times. Cover the pan and cook for 1 minute. Uncover and turn the spinach over again. Cover the pan and cook for an additional minute.",
    "After 2 minutes of covered cooking the spinach should be completely wilted. Remove from heat.",
    "Drain any excess moisture from the pan. Add a little more olive oil, sprinkle with salt to taste. Serve immediately.",
