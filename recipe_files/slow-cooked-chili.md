## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground beef
- 2 (16 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 2 onions, chopped

- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Directions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.

2. Combine ground beef, kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and water in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low for 10 hours, or High for 4 hours.
